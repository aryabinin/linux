Kernel address sanitizer
================

0. Overview
===========

Kernel Address sanitizer (KASan) is a dynamic memory error detector. It provides
fast and comprehensive solution for finding use-after-free and out-of-bounds bugs.

KASAN uses compile-time instrumentation for checking every memory access, therefore you
will need a special compiler: GCC >= 5.0.0.

Currently KASAN supported only for x86_64 architecture and requires kernel
to be build with SLUB allocator.

1. Usage
=========

KASAN requires the kernel to be built with a special compiler (GCC >= 5.0.0).

To enable KASAN configure kernel with:

	  CONFIG_KASAN = y

Currently KASAN works only with SLUB.
For better bug detection and nicer report enable CONFIG_STACKTRACE, CONFIG_SLUB_DEBUG
and put 'slub_debug=FU' to boot cmdline.
Please don't use slab poisoning with KASan (slub_debug=P), beacuse if KASan will
detects use after free allocation and free stacktraces will be overwritten by
poison bytes, and KASan won't be able to print this backtraces.

To exclude files from being instrumented by compiler, add a line
similar to the following to the respective kernel Makefile:


        For a single file (e.g. main.o):
                KASAN_SANITIZE_main.o := n

        For all files in one directory:
                KASAN_SANITIZE := n

Only files which are linked to the main kernel image or are compiled as
kernel modules are supported by this mechanism.


1.1 Error reports
==========

A typical out of bounds access report looks like this:

==================================================================

In the last section the report shows memory state around the accessed address.
Reading this part requires some more undestanding of how KASAN works.

Each KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE bytes of memory can be marked as addressable,
partially addressable, freed or they can be part of a redzone.
If bytes are marked as addressable that means that they belong to some
allocated memory block and it is possible to read or modify any of these
bytes. Addressable KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE bytes are marked by 0 in the report.
When only the first N bytes of KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE belong to an allocated
memory block, this bytes are partially addressable and marked by 'N'.

Markers of unaccessible bytes could be found in mm/kasan/kasan.h header:

#define KASAN_FREE_PAGE         0xFF  /* page was freed */
#define KASAN_PAGE_REDZONE      0xFE  /* redzone for kmalloc_large allocations */
#define KASAN_SLAB_PADDING      0xFD  /* Slab page redzone, does not belong to any slub object */
#define KASAN_KMALLOC_REDZONE   0xFC  /* redzone inside slub object */
#define KASAN_KMALLOC_FREE      0xFB  /* object was freed (kmem_cache_free/kfree) */
#define KASAN_SLAB_FREE         0xFA  /* free slab page */
#define KASAN_SHADOW_GAP        0xF9  /* address belongs to shadow memory */

In the report above the arrows point to the shadow byte 03, which means that the
accessed address is partially addressable.


2. Implementation details
========================

From a high level, our approach to memory error detection is similar to that
of kmemcheck: use shadow memory to record whether each byte of memory is safe
to access, and use compile-time instrumentation to check shadow on each memory
access.

AddressSanitizer dedicates 1/8 of the addressable in kernel memory to its shadow
memory (e.g. 16TB to cover 128TB on x86_64) and uses direct mapping with a
scale and offset to translate a memory address to its corresponding shadow address.

Here is function witch translate address to corresponding shadow address:

unsigned long kasan_mem_to_shadow(unsigned long addr)
{
	return ((addr - KASAN_SHADOW_START) >> KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT)
		+ KASAN_SHADOW_START;
}

where KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SHIFT = 3.

Each shadow byte corresponds to 8 bytes of the main memory. We use the
following encoding for each shadow byte: 0 means that all 8 bytes of the
corresponding memory region are addressable; k (1 <= k <= 7) means that
the first k bytes are addressable, and other (8 - k) bytes are not;
any negative value indicates that the entire 8-byte word is unaddressable.
We use different negative values to distinguish between different kinds of
unaddressable memory (redzones, freed memory) (see mm/kasan/kasan.h).

Poisoning or unpoisoning a byte in the main memory means writing some special
value into the corresponding shadow memory. This value indicates whether the
byte is addressable or not.
